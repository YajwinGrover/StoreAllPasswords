# StoreAllPasswords

This is CLI password manager. I created this project as a way to store your passwords locally on your device in a secure fernet encrytion.
I am still working on adding features to make it better. Feel free to create an issue for a feature you want, and I'll try adding it.

QUICK NOTE: The json file is not included so if you want to use my code, you can but make sure to change lines #45,50 and 60 to the path of your json file. Also change line #10 to the path of a file which the first line consists of a fernet key, and the second line the master key
